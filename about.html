        <h2>About Dr. DeHarpporte</h2>
        <p>I want to help you make the changes in your life that will help you move forward. Whether it’s overcoming worries, tackling academic issues, or better navigating relationships, I want to be there holding space for you to work through the tough stuff and cheering you on when you make progress. I am also trained in a trauma treatment called Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), which can be especially helpful if you want to work on ways that past trauma continues to impact you. </p> <break></break>

        <p>If you see me as a therapist, you can expect us to work together to figure things out. I probably won’t tell you what to do, but what I will do is give you space to talk through your own thoughts and feelings and encourage you to listen to your inner voice. I’ll help you see the patterns that have gotten in your way, and together we’ll experiment with new ways to do things. I might check in along the way to make sure that what we’re doing fits for you.</p> <break></break>

        <p>I am an optimist. In my years as a therapist, I have seen people make remarkable changes, and I love being part of that process. I believe in the power of relationship and connection to inspire growth. I don’t think therapy needs to be painful, and I don’t think it should last forever. In fact, my goal is to be on your team for as little time as necessary for you to make the positive changes you want to see in your life. I would love to have the opportunity to meet you and learn how I can help! </p>
